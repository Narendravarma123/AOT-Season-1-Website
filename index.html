                <p>The main hero (or antihero) of the series who, after witnessing his mother being devoured by a Titan while escaping his hometown as a young boy, dedicates his life to their eradication and joins the Survey Corps. After graduating fifth in his cadet class, he is swallowed by a bearded Titan during his first mission in Trost. However, he soon reappears as a 15-meter (49 ft) Titan who fights other Titans on equal ground. His ability as a Titan makes him the target of multiple parties that include those who see him as a tool to eradicate the Titans, other humans who can become Titans, and those who perceive Eren as a rebellion-inducing threat to the status quo. Placed into the Survey Corps' Special Operations Squad, he attempts to control his Titan-changing ability and discovers he has other abilities as well. In the final arc, Eren becomes the main antagonist, believing that the only way to fulfill his own corrupted view of freedom and for Paradis Island to survive endless war and racism against the Eldian people is to unleash millions of Colossal Titans in a genocidal crusade against the rest of the world. [1] Author Hajime Isayama stated that Eren's Titan form's physique was modeled after middleweight mixed martial artist Yushin Okami.
                    Eren is voiced by Yuki Kaji in Japanese, he is voiced by Bryce Papenbrook in the English dub.In the live-action film, Eren is portrayed by Haruma Miura. <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eren_Yeager" target="new">Read more</a></b></p>

                <p>Mikasa is Eren's childhood friend who was taken in by his family after seeing her parents brutally murdered by human traffickers. Though never officially adopted by the Jaeger family nor thinking of Eren's parents as her own, she felt a strong sense of gratitude toward them as caretakers, as well as Eren, who saved her life and gave her an iconic scarf. Her parents' tragic deaths had overwhelming influence on her, causing her to lose her innocence and realize the world's cruelty. This caused her personality to become more quiet and withdrawn, maintaining a stoic expression except when it comes to Eren and her friends. As Eren's committed caretaker, she feels compelled to follow and protect him at all costs, even joining him in the Survey Corps. Graduating from the Training Corps at the top of her class, she is regarded by officers as an unprecedented genius and prodigy, easily worth a hundred soldiers in battle. As later revealed, this is due to Mikasa's father being a descendant of the Ackerman clan, an Eldian bloodline that was genetically modified to create super soldiers equal to a Titan in strength, originally designed to protect Eldia's king. When under duress, these genetically inherited abilities may allow a descendant access to their ancestors' battle experience. Mikasa's Ackerman instincts were first awakened in the aftermath of her parents' deaths when Eren urged her to 'fight' back against her kidnappers. Though technically half-blooded, she is also the last known person of Asian descent residing in the Walls. A wrist tattoo inherited from her mother indicates that she is descended from the prominent Azumabito family, a cadet Shogun branch from the Oriental nation of Hizuru, whose ancestors migrated from their native land to Paradis as honored ambassadors. While investigating the Marleyan Volunteers alongside the Survey Corps, Eren reveals to Mikasa that he has always hated her for being enslaved to her Ackerman blood that "forces" her to protect him. In turn, she becomes despondent and removes her scarf from her neck. While still caring for Eren, Mikasa decides to join the alliance to stop Eren's planned genocide on the world.
In the author's blog, her name is noted to come from the Mikasa, a famous pre-dreadnought battleship of the Imperial Japanese Navy.
Mikasa is voiced by Yui Ishikawa in Japanese, and Trina Nishimura in English dub. In the live-action film, she is portrayed by Kiko Mizuhara. Ishikawa says that Mikasa cares mainly about Eren, and keeps a distance from the rest of the world. She says that "While she might seem like a character with so few emotional levels, there are actually many feelings that swirl around her heart.</p>

                <p>Armin is Eren and Mikasa's other childhood friend who joins them in order to help humanity and fulfill his dream of seeing the outside world. When Armin was young, his parents tried to venture beyond the Wall by creating a hot air balloon but were found out and killed by the First Interior Squad of the Military Police, leaving Armin to be raised by his grandfather. Armin's grandfather secretly possessed an illegal book containing information about the world beyond the Walls, which Armin later found and read. Fascinated by descriptions of gigantic body of saltwater, fire water, land made of ice, and fields of sand, Armin showed it to his best friend Eren, kindling his desire to see the outside world. After the fall of Wall Maria, Armin's grandfather was sent along with 1/5 of the population (mostly Wall Maria refugees) on a high-risk operation to "reclaim Wall Maria" and died as a result, leaving Armin an orphan and the only survivor of his family. The expedition was, in reality, a scheme contrived by the Royal Government to cull the number of refugees and alleviate food shortages.
                    After joining the Training Corps with Eren and Mikasa, Armin initially had an inferiority complex regarding how he fell behind his companions in combat and endurance. He often laments over his self-perceived cowardliness and dependence on his friends, but his confidence slowly grew when he realized that he could use his brain and strategic abilities to help them. Vigorously defending Eren from the military after he was revealed to be a Titan, he eventually brought him out of his feral Titan state following the latter's second full transformation where he attacks Mikasa. Armin also impresses his superiors by correctly deducing the human identity of the Female Titan and convinces Eren to overcome his hesitation to fight her during their confrontation in Stohess District. Later chapters describe him as being intelligent, a talented tactician with good judgement, and having the ability to think outside the box. During a battle in Shinganshina, Armin comes up with a plan to capture Bertolt but is mortally wounded from the severe burns he sustained.Levi saves Armin by injecting him with Titan serum, and Armin then acquires the Colossal Titan's power by eating Bertolt. After investigating the Volunteers to learn Zeke and Eren's intentions, he is imprisoned in Shiganshina district by the Yeagerists. During the Marleyan ambush, he battles Pieck, before becoming horrified upon learning Eren's intentions to utilize the full rumbling. He later joins the alliance to stop Eren from destroying all life outside Paradis.
                    Armin is voiced by Marina Inoue in Japanese, and Josh Grelle in the English dub. In the live-action feature film, Kanata Hongō plays Armin. Inoue describes Armin as "withdrawn but slowly grows to the point where he's able to say what he believes".</p>

                <p>He is known as humanity's most powerful soldier and head of an elite squad in the Survey Corps. Hange remarks that he is a bit of a "clean freak". While it is said that he is blunt and unapproachable, it is noted that he has a strong respect for authority, structure and discipline. The side story Attack on Titan: No Regrets focuses on Levi's origins, revealing that he was part of a band of thieves using the Vertical Maneuvering Equipment to commit crimes before he is scouted by Erwin to join the army. Captain Kenny Ackerman later notes that the capture of Eren and Historia has to do with Levi, whom he refers to as "Levi Ackerman". Kenny is later revealed to be Levi's maternal uncle, who raised him after his mother Kuchel's death. Later, in the Attack On Titan manga, Levi is injured by an explosion engineered by Zeke Yeager (brother of Eren Jaeger). He was in a near-death state until Hange Zoe found him and escaped with his body later to make an alliance with Commander Theo Magath and Pieck Finger in order to take down Eren Jaeger. Eventually, Levi recovers and joins the others in battle, managing to kill Zeke, fulfilling his promise to Erwin in killing the Beast Titan. Levi was modeled after the Watchmen character Rorschach[28] and is named after a child Isayama noticed in the documentary Jesus Camp. Levi is voiced by Hiroshi Kamiya and by Matthew Mercer in the English dub.</p>

Eren Jaeger, of the town called the Shiganshina District, wishes to see the outside world by joining the Scout Regiment, as he likens living in the cities to livestock. Despite this, his friend Mikasa Ackermann and their mother Carla Jaeger are against him joining the Scouts. Even after seeing the Scouts return home with large casualties, Eren expresses his interest to join, which impresses his father Grisha Jaeger, who promises to show him what lies in their basement once he returns. After Eren and Mikasa rescue their friend Armin Arlert from a group of delinquents, the Colossal Titan, a 60m Titan, suddenly appears and knocks down the gate to the Shiganshina District, which lies in the outer edge of Wall Maria, allowing smaller Titans to enter. As the town erupts into mass panic, Eren and Mikasa rush back to their house, only to see Carla pinned under their collapsed house. As a Smiling Titan approaches them, Carla begs them to flee, but they refuse until city guard Hannes arrives and assures them that he will defend them. However, as he charges towards the Titan, he is overcome with fear and takes Eren and Mikasa away. Eren watches in horror as a Smiling Titan eats Carla.</td>

Some time later, Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rose as the latter do not like sharing their food or homes with the refugees. During the next year, as a food shortage becomes apparent, the government orders the refugees to either work on the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria. About 250,000 people, 20% of the populace, choose to fight, only to be wiped out by the Titans. Eren vows revenge and joins the army along with Mikasa and Armin.</td>

Eren develops a rivalry with Jean Kirschtein, who desires a safe and easy position in the Military Police Regiment within the inner city walls. The recruits train on an omni-directional mobility gear[10] apparatus, where they have to balance themselves while suspended on cables. After Eren has trouble balancing, he asks Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help and discover they too are among the few who have personally encountered Titans.

Assigned by Commander Kitts Woerman of the Garrison Regiment to different squads, Mikasa helps with the evacuation, while Eren and Armin provide backup at the front lines. With the Titans now in the city, Eren recalls his lessons that in order to kill a Titan, they must strike the nape of its neck. As Eren and Armin's squad attack, their comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans one by one, with Eren himself losing his left leg. Armin, paralyzed with fear upon seeing his comrades' fates, is picked up by a Bearded Titan and almost swallowed.

In the year 844, a year before the fall of Wall Maria, Mikasa was targeted by three slave traders, who murdered her parents in a struggle. After Grisha and Eren discovered the corpses while making a visit, Eren secretly tracked down the slave traders to a nearby hut and killed two of them in an attempt to save Mikasa. However, the third slave trader appeared and began strangling Eren. Encouraged by Eren, Mikasa overcame her fear and gained resolve to kill the third slave trader. After the children are found by the Military Police Regiment, Mikasa was invited to live with Eren and Grisha.

Armin tentatively convinces Kitts, only to have him be overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more. The order is halted when Commander Dot Pyxis and his men intervene, sparing their lives. In return, Pyxis asks Eren if he will transform himself to block the gap in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in.

As Armin heads toward Eren to investigate, the elite squadron argues and eventually agrees to protect Eren instead of abandoning him, still recognizing him as a valuable military asset. During the operation, Jean is separated from Connie and Annie after his omni-directional mobility gear malfunctions, forcing him to hide from two Titans in a building. Armin reaches the unconscious Eren, but Mikasa calls to him, warning that he is in a dangerous state. Armin plunges his sword into Eren's left arm, which briefly awakens him. As Armin speaks to him of the outside world and reminds him of his promise to kill all the Titans, Eren leaves his dreamlike state and regains control.</td>

All Titans remaining in the Trost Districts are eliminated except two, which are captured for research. Jean, Sasha and Annie all mourn the deaths of their fellow comrades among several casualties. Meanwhile, Eren is chained in a cell guarded by the Military Police Regiment, where he is visited by Levi and Commander Erwin Smith of the Scout Regiment. After listening to his story and reasons for wanting the Titans dead, Levi allows Eren to join his squad under his command, though Eren is warned that Levi would personally kill him if he ever betrays the squad or loses control again.</td>

Eren is brought to a military tribunal to be judged by Commander-in-Chief Dhalis Zachary, who will decide whether Eren should be given to the Military Police Regiment or the Scout Regiment, both of whom have their own reasons for wanting him. The Military Police Regiment wants Eren killed as he is seen by them as a menace, while the Scout Regiment wants to use him to retake Wall Maria. Becoming furious upon hearing from a merchant that Mikasa is accused of being a Titan as well, Eren calls out the Military Police Regiment and their supporters for their cowardice. Levi brutally beats down Eren in retaliation, but Eren does not transform into a Titan. Levi uses this to show to the court that the Scout Regiment can control Eren, and proposes that Eren is to be made part of his squad. In the end, Zachary gives Eren to the Scout Regiment, where Erwin and Hange Zoë welcome him. As Eren is getting treatment for his wounds, they discover that he grew back a tooth knocked out after being beaten down by Levi.</td>

Meanwhile, Erwin and Miche Zacharius discuss the new recruits joining the Scout Regiment and how they must prove Eren's usefulness to Military Command within a month. Hange asks Eren to help her in her experiments with the two Titans they have captured, which she named Sawney and Beane. She has an obsession with Titans where she treats them like people despite the many times she puts herself in danger. It is revealed that the Titans need sunlight to survive and their bodies are disproportionately light despite their size. The next day, the Scout Regiment discover that Sawney and Beane have been killed. As Hange mourns for them, the Scout Regiment deduce that the culprit is a soldier who escaped using their omni-directional mobility gear, which makes Eren wonder who their true enemy is.</td>

During a break when he tried to pick up a teaspoon, Eren suddenly partially transformed, leading Hange to deduce that Eren is able to transform into a Titan not by solely injuring himself but also due to his desire to fulfill his goals. The squad apologized to Eren and told him they should trust each other. Remembering this, Eren decides to trust his squad's plan.

The Scout Regiment retrieves the corpses of their fallen comrades, with Erwin ordering that the lost corpses be reported missing in action.
